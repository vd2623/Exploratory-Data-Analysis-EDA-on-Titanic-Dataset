# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset

Objective
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about the passengers and their survival rates. This involves examining the data to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies that can inform hypotheses about the factors influencing survival.

Steps Involved
Data Loading and Understanding:

Load the dataset using libraries like Pandas.
Understand the structure of the dataset by looking at the first few rows, data types, and summary statistics.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values in columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Convert categorical variables into numeric values if necessary.
Remove duplicates if any.
Data Exploration:

Univariate Analysis:
Analyze individual columns to understand their distribution and characteristics.
Use histograms, bar plots, and box plots for visualizing distributions of continuous and categorical variables.
Bivariate Analysis:
Examine the relationship between pairs of variables.
Use scatter plots, bar plots, and correlation matrices.
Multivariate Analysis:
Explore interactions between three or more variables.
Use heatmaps, pair plots, and advanced visualizations.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might be relevant for analysis, such as:
FamilySize: combining SibSp and Parch.
Title: extracting titles from names.
IsAlone: indicating if a passenger is alone.
Transform existing features if necessary.
Visualization:

Use visualizations to summarize findings and illustrate key insights.
Common visualizations include:
Survival Rate by Class: Compare survival rates across different passenger classes (Pclass).
Survival Rate by Sex: Compare survival rates between males and females.
Age Distribution of Survivors: Analyze the age distribution of survivors versus non-survivors.
Fare Distribution: Examine the distribution of fares and their relationship with survival.
Embarked Location: Analyze survival rates based on the port of embarkation.
Statistical Analysis:

Perform statistical tests to validate findings.
Use chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.
Reporting:

Summarize the findings in a report or presentation.
Highlight key insights, patterns, and any surprising discoveries.
Discuss potential implications and hypotheses based on the EDA.
Tools and Libraries
